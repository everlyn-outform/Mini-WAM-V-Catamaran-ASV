# ðŸš¤ Mini WAM-V Catamaran ASV (Raspberry Pi Edition)

A small-scale autonomous catamaran inspired by WAM-V designs. This version is powered by a Raspberry Pi and integrates motor control, GPS logging, IMU orientation tracking, and ultrasonic obstacle detection. It also supports exporting real-world logs to **ASVLite**, a lightweight marine simulation framework, to visualize and debug missions.

---

## âœ¨ Project Goals

- Build a stable, dual-hull robot boat that behaves like a WAM-V
- Integrate real-time sensor data from GPS, IMU, and ultrasonic rangefinder
- Visualize and simulate boat behavior in waves using [ASVLite](https://github.com/resilient-swarms/ASVLite)
- Practice end-to-end workflow: simulate â†’ test â†’ deploy â†’ analyze

---

## ðŸ”§ Core Features

- Differential DC motor control via Raspberry Pi
- Real-time GPS logging (NEO-6M)
- Roll/pitch/acceleration via IMU (MPU6050)
- Obstacle detection with waterproof ultrasonic (JSN-SR04T)
- Logs all data into timestamped CSV
- Optional: Convert log to ASVLite sim input for visualization

---

## ðŸ§  Skills Practiced

- Raspberry Pi GPIO control + UART serial
- Sensor fusion prep (GPS + IMU)
- Real-world robotics stability testing
- Log-based simulation + analysis (digital twin concept)
- Embedded Python scripting for autonomy
